# web-design-challenge

#index.html is the landing page and was created first. It contains a navbar (used in all html pages), a summary, and a visualization
#panel on the right-hand side with clickable images that route to each of the four individual visualization html pages.

#each of the four visualization html pages has the navbar html and the data corresponding to that visualization (e.g. humidity data for humidity.html)
#these also copy over the same visulization sidebar, so the only thing that's really changing is the col-md-8 part (left two-thirds of the row-container)
